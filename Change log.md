# Date / What has changed / Why
2016/06/09 / Made make() method to be one many methods / Clearly more more refined way to chaing methods was needed.
2016/06/09 / Added get() method / Get() now works as the main method to chain other methods. Also all methods can be called as single methods.
2016/06/09 / Changed name from make() to style() / Need to get as close to natural way of writing things.
2016/06/22 / Changed style() method name to form() due to ambiguity. Fixed addEvent method to pull only selected document objects. Added contain() method to contain items.
